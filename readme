Beans: are the fundamental building blocks of a Spring application. They represent the various components of your application, 
such as controllers, services, repositories, and more.

You don't typically create beans manually using the new keyword. Instead, you define them in your Spring configuration 
(using XML, annotations, or Java configuration), and the Spring container takes care of instantiating, configuring, and assembling them.
